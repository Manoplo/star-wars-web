                <h3>The ‘Obi-Wan Kenobi’ Show Is Finally In Production</h3>
                <p>
                  Production on Obi-Wan Kenobi is officially underway. The news
                  was revealed by Star Wars actor Ewan McGregor during a remote
                  interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live! McGregor joined the interview
                  from the very studio where the Disney+ series is currently
                  filming. Read More: The Obi-Wan Kenobi Show Is Finally In

                  <p>
                    which led Kimmel to ask him what the consequences of leaking
                    information would be. “I don’t think they can fire me, no,”
                    McGregor admitted. “But they wouldn’t be at all happy with
                    me. Nor would anybody else. It would be a shame to spoil —
                    that’s the thing about all these reveals, it just spoils it
                    for the fans.fss”

                    my life, and that’s all I can tell you about it,” he stated.
                    The actor also added that the production has “some great

                <h3>Obi-Wan Kenobi series release date speculation</h3>
                <p>
                  Outside of The Book of Boba Fett arriving in December 2021,
                  Disney and Lucasfilm haven't revealed any release dates for
                  their live-action output in a galaxy far, far away. So, no
                  Obi-Wan Kenobi series release date just yet – though filming
                  is now wrapped up. As per the official Star Wars site, cameras
                  started rolling in April 2021, and the featurette released
                  during Disney Plus Day confirmed a 2022 release date.
                </p>

                <div class="article-footer-sub">
                  <h4>
                    Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney Plus Day featurette and concept art
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    There might not be an official trailer just yet, but a
                    preview featurette was unveiled at Disney Plus Day, and can
                    be viewed on the streamer now. It reveals concept art for
                    the show, including the picture of Obi-Wan and Anakin
                    duelling it out above, and also sees Ewan McGregor talk
                    about the series.

                  <h4>Obi-Wan Kenobi series cast</h4>
                  <p>
                    Of course, an Obi-Wan series wouldn’t feel quite right
                    without the man himself: Ewan McGregor is indeed returning
                    as Obi-Wan. Alongside him is quite the cast, though the
                    standout name for fans of all things a galaxy far, far away
                    is Hayden Christensen. He’ll be reprising his role as Darth
                    Vader, marking the first on-screen appearance for the actor
                    in Star Wars since 2005’s Revenge of the Sith.
